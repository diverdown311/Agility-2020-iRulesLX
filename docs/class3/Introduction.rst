Introduction to iRules LX
=========================

In this lab we will learn how to use iRules LX with a basic example. We
will have a web application that has a web form. When submitting the form, the
page will display our POST data. As part of the lab exercise, we will
apply an LX iRule that will convert the form POST data into JSON and
change the Content-Type header.

**Using Your Lab Environment**

Connect to the Windows Jumpbox via RDP (Instructor will provide credentials)

**How to Access the Labs**

You will receive instructions from your proctor on how to access the 
workstation in the lab.  On this workstation, you will have the
following applications –

- Atom Editor – For viewing lab code with syntax highlighting. When you open up Atom, you will
  see a list of files that will be used in these labs.
- Chrome Web Browser – For testing the applications we create and BIG-IP management access.
  Links are bookmarked just below the address bar.
- Putty SSH Client – For accessing the BASH and TMSH command line of the BIG-IP. The BIG-IP
  properties have been saved to the session labeled *BIG-IP*.
